# Ambilight project

##### One more realization ...

> We had one cheep 12V LED tape,  one breadboard, Arduino UNO , three MOSFET transistors auirf1010z , and a whole galaxy of multi-colored wires...
Not that we needed all that for the project, but once you get locked into a serious radio components collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

## How to repeat the project

#### Arduino part

First, we have to assemble the circuit according to the schema.  Good explanation can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/usage)

![Schema](https://github.com/vanyason/Ambilight/blob/master/resources/https://github.com/vanyason/Ambilight/blob/master/resources/led_strips_ledstripbjt.gif)
![Result](https://github.com/vanyason/Ambilight/blob/master/resources/NLWdnasIqUc.jpg)

Then load [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/vanyason/Ambilight/tree/master/arduino_controller_2) to the Arduino

#### Desktop part
Open [project](https://github.com/vanyason/Ambilight/tree/master/QT_PC_controller/qController) with the QT creator and compile it. You can also find Java version in the project - deprecated
realization. You can fix it and use, if you don`t like QT.


## Enjoy
